Initially, we were going to make courses for 4 programming languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. 
We are also planning to expand our arrangement
of courses with SQL, C++, C#, JAVA and C. Creating a big community is also on our list of plans. To accomplish this we
will be making a community forum where you can talk to anyone about your questions or other problems/accomplishments.
You will be able to get your own certificate after completing one of our courses. In there we will state what you\'ve
accomplished with a signature from the creators. ProLearner started as a school project but is now growing immensely fast.',
